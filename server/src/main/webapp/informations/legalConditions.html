        <h2>Conditions & Notices</h2>
        <p>These Conditions and Notices are dated May 2019</p>


        <h3>A. CONDITIONS OF CONTRACT AND OTHER IMPORTANT NOTICES NOTICE</h3>

        <p>If the Passenger's journey involves an ultimate destination or stop in a country other than the country of
            departure, the Warsaw Convention, the Warsaw Convention as amended or the Montreal Convention may be
            applicable,
            depending on the journey. These Conventions govern and may limit the liability of Carriers in respect of
            death
            or personal injury, or in respect of loss of or Damage to Baggage, and delay. Many Carriers have waived the
            Warsaw Convention Limits for death or bodily injury. Further information may be obtained from the Carrier.
            See
            also notices headed "Advice to International Passengers on Limitation of Liability" and "Notice of Baggage
            Liability Limitations" below.
        </p>

        <h3>Acceptable Travel Documents</h3>

        <p>According to Technical Security Directive No. (1) – 1st TSD, which is part of the National Civil Aviation
            Security Program (EPAPA) and was published in the Government Gazette on 24 August 2016, issue no. 2607, the
            boarding pass must be in the name of the person who presents it and to this end the airline is responsible
            for
            verifying identification of departing Passengers on the basis of either a passport or identification card
            issued
            by police. A driving license or other official document bearing a photograph of the Passenger is also
            acceptable
            for travelling on domestic flights. Passports, ID cards, driving licenses or other official documents
            presented
            by third parties on behalf of other Passengers shall not be accepted. For Passengers under age 12 travelling
            on
            domestic flights who do not have a passport, ID card or other official document, it is possible to show an
            identity verification document issued by a Citizen Service Centre (KEP) or the police. In exceptional cases
            and
            only for reasons of force majeure (e.g. health reasons), a written statement by the accompanying adult to
            the
            airline regarding the identity of the minor departing Passenger shall suffice for domestic flights. It
            should be
            noted that Passengers are wholly responsible for acquiring and being in possession of the appropriate valid
            and
            lawful travel documents before travelling, along with any other documents required, such as entry visa,
            residence permit, or authorisation under the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) when
            travelling
            to the USA under the Visa Waiver Program. AIR VACATION or its subsidiaries are not responsible for any
            direct, indirect, coincidental, specific, property or accessory Damage that occurs as a result of Passenger
            inability to procure the appropriate travel documents before travelling.
        </p>
