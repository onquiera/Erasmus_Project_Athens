        <h2>PRIVACY POLICY</h2>

        <p>At Air Asmus, we care about your privacy.</p>
        <br>
        <p> Any personal information collected during visits to our websites is processed in accordance with the provisions
        of Belgian law, in particular with the Belgian Law of 8 December 1992 on the protection of privacy relating to
        the processing of personal data and its implementing acts.</p>
        <br>
        <p>We process your personal information if you provide it to us yourself, for example, during registration, as part
        of a survey or competition, or during contractual transactions (e.g. booking a flight), and, in the measure that
        you allow it, to inform you about services in which you are likely to be interested (e.g. to receive updates on
        Air Asmus).</p>
        <br>
        <p>In addition to information connected with services for which you have subscribed, we may contact you with
        information about our other products and services that may be of interest to you.</p>
        <br>
        <p>We will only use your personal data for the purposes indicated above.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Air Asmus will not disclose, sell, rent or exchange your personal data to any other organisation or entity,
        unless you are first notified and have expressly agreed with it, or as otherwise required by law, with the
        exception that communications of personal data to companies whose intervention as data processors, acting on our
        behalf and under our sole control, is required to accomplish the purposes indicated above.</p>
        <br>
        <p>When you fly to certain destination countries, Air Asmus is required by law to transfer certain passenger
        information to the security or customs authorities of those countries. If Government agencies or authorities ask
        us to collect or share personal data, we will do so only within the appropriate legal frameworks.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Air Asmus uses technical and organisational security measures to protect the data we hold about you, against
        accidental or deliberate manipulation, loss, deletion or unauthorised access. Our security measures are being
        improved continuously as new technology develops.</p>
        <br>
        <p>You have the right to access and restrict your data and, where appropriate, request rectification of any
        erroneous data relating to you. You may furthermore, at any moment, object by means of a simple request and free
        of charge, to the future processing of personal data relating to you for the purpose of direct marketing. These
        rights may be exercised by sending an email, including any questions you may have, to the following address:
